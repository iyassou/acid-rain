# AcidRain

**AcidRain** is a game where you guide a player through the acid raindrops falling down the screen.

It's meant to run on a [PewPew v10.2](https://pewpew.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pewpew10/overview.html), and makes use of [MicroQiskit](https://github.com/quantumjim/MicroQiskit) to add quantum tunnelling to its gameplay mechanics.

It was conceived at the University of Birmingham's CSS / Qiskit Hackathon on Saturday, November 16th. That version along with a fleshed-out, explanatory README of its coding process are viewable in the `qiskit_hackathon` folder.

The version presented at the root of this repo is the leaner version made later, which most notably implements the quantum tunnelling gameplay feature in a less erroneous and physically more consistent manner, made possible thanks to the excellent Wikipedia page on [rectangular potential barriers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectangular_potential_barrier) and the help of a Qiskit advocate at the hackathon.
